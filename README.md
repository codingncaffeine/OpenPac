# Pac-Man Clone 🟡👻

A fun, from-scratch Pac-Man clone written in Python using **Pygame**.

This project recreates the classic arcade experience with smooth gameplay, original-like ghosts AI (with a bit of personality), power pellets, score tracking, lives, and that satisfying "waka-waka" sound.

- Classic Pac-Man gameplay on the original maze layout
- Four unique ghosts with distinct behaviors:
  - Blinky (red) – chases Pac-Man directly
  - Pinky (pink) – ambushes ahead of Pac-Man
  - Inky (cyan) – complex flanking using Blinky’s position
  - Clyde (orange) – sometimes chases, sometimes runs home
  - Scary (Blue) - no idea I'm just making this up
- Scatter and Chase modes + Frightened (blue) mode when eating power pellets
- Power pellet effects, fruit bonuses, and increasing difficulty
- Score, high score, lives, and ready/start screens
- Authentic sound effects and music (optional toggle)
- Clean, well-commented code – perfect for learning game development or AI logic or just goofing around

I don't actually own the audio assets here so I'm not
applying a license and don't recommend using this for
a commercial game.  This is just for fun!
