# Pac-Man Clone 🟡👻

A fun, from-scratch Pac-Man clone written in Python using **Pygame**.

This project recreates the classic arcade experience with smooth gameplay, original-like ghosts AI (with a bit of personality), power pellets, score tracking, lives, and that satisfying "waka-waka" sound.

- Classic Pac-Man gameplay on the original maze layout
- Five unique ghosts with distinct behaviors:
  - Blinky (red) – chases Pac-Man directly
  - Pinky (pink) – ambushes ahead of Pac-Man
  - Inky (cyan) – complex flanking using Blinky’s position
  - Clyde (orange) – sometimes chases, sometimes runs home
  - Scary (Blue) - no idea I'm just making this up
- Scatter and Chase modes + Frightened (blue) mode when eating power pellets
- Power pellet effects, fruit bonuses, and increasing difficulty
- Score, high score, lives, and ready/start screens
- Authentic sound effects and music (optional toggle)
- Clean, well-commented code – perfect for learning game development or AI logic or just goofing around

  Note:  Some bugs still remain in the game.  For instance you can get pacman stuck if you press up while going through the warp tunnel.
  It's possible that ghosts may get stuck in a wall if a generated level has a dead end.  I think I've fixed that but I'm not confident.
  This game was made for learning purposes and will never be sold and shouldn't be.  The audio assets are placeholder and should be replaced.
